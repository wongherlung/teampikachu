An estimated 14 billion pounds of trash, mostly plastic, is dumped in the world's oceans every year.

By adding a simple sensor to every recycling bin, we help gamify recycling to make it more appealing to the crowd.
An iPhone acts as a console for the user to interact with, as well as a makeshift motion sensor that can detect the number of items recycled by a person and converts them to points.

Once the person is done recycling, a satisfying jackpot machine sound activates to congratulate him.  
The console then displays a QR code for the recycling master to scan and a web dashboard then shows their ranking and points they could use to change for coupons or gifts.

Built in data analytics is also available for respective recycling companies where they can better visualize the correlation between their recycling programs and its effectiveness.
